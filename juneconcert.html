<P><FONT SIZE=3>Dear Orchestra Members,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Thanks for all your hard
work. The concert will be June 11, and it promises to be very
exciting.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>LOCATION:</B> The
auditorium of Eckstein Middle School, 3003 NE 75th. From the
community center, go north to 75th, turn right, and go up the hill to
30th. The school is on your right (south side). There is parking in
front, on the west side, and in a lot on the east side of the school.
Enter the main door, and you can&rsquo;t miss the auditorium.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>DRESS:</B> Anything
white on top, anything black on bottom</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>SCHEDULE:</B> We will
have a warm up/rehearsal prior to the performance.  <B>The Monday
orchestra should arrive at 6:45 to help set up, tune and begin our
last short rehearsal at</B> <B>7:00 sharp; the Wednesday orchestra
should be ready to rehearse by 7:20</B>. Note that this is different
from last time. Plan to arrive a little early so that we can tune
with extra care.  Please keep your music with you when you&rsquo;re
not playing, so that it doesn&rsquo;t get mixed up with the other
orchestra. We&rsquo;ll open the door to your friends and relatives at
7:55 and begin the concert at 8 pm. After the performance we will
have refreshments. The Monday orchestra should contribute something
simple to drink for the refreshment table. The Wednesday orchestra
should bring something to eat. Note that this is reversed from last
time.  </FONT>
</P>
<BR>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Many little tasks need to
be done before and after the rehearsal/concert, and we would be
appreciative if some of you would volunteer 3-5 minutes of your time
to help. The Monday players could help by setting up chairs on the
stage, passing out programs or getting the lighting figured out, The
Wednesday orchestra players could help by setting up the table for
refreshments and and restoring the stage to its original
configuration after the concert. If everyone would be responsible for
taking home any extra food or drink  brought, the general cleanup
will be very simple. Thanks in advance for your help. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>We will take the summer
off. In late August the fall schedule will be set and you will get an
e-mail announcement of the beginning dates. It will be in the later
half of September. If you know you will or won&rsquo;t be joining us
please tell us; it helps with planning music. Also, if you change
your e-mail address please let us know.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=3>Have a wonderful summer!</FONT></P>
