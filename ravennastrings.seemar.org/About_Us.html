            <font color="#666666">One day Lorraine (pictured left) and
              Judy walked their dogs around Green Lake. They discussed
              what they might do upon retirement. One idea was to lick
              envelopes; the other was to start a community orchestra.
              They chose the second alternative and began immediately.</font><font

              The Ravenna String Orchestra was organized in 1996. As the
              membership grew and the players became more advanced, a
              second orchestra was begun at Langston Hughes Center for
              the Arts in 2000. This orchestra later gravitated to the
              Ravenna-Eckstein Community Center where it became known as
              the Ravenna Second String Orchestra. All rehearsals are at
              this community center, 6535 Ravenna Ave. NE, but our
              increasing numbers have necessitated presenting the
              quarterly concerts in the nearby auditorium of Eckstein
              Middle School, 3003 NE 75th St. There are three sessions
              each year in the fall, winter and spring, each followed by
              a concert. <br>
