<p>Dear Orchestra Members,

<p>Thanks for all your hard work.  The concert will be April 2, and it
promises to be wonderful.

<p>LOCATION: The auditorium of Eckstein Middle School, 3003 NE 75th.
From the community center, go north to 75th, turn right, and go up
the hill to 30th.  The school is on your right (south side).  There
is parking in front, on the west side, an d in a lot on the east
side of the school.  Enter the main door, and you can't miss the
auditorium.

<p>DRESS: Anything white on top, anything black on bottom

<p>SCHEDULE: We will have a warm up/rehearsal prior to the performance.
The Wednesday orchestra should arrive at 6:45 to help set up, tune
and begin our last short rehearsal at 7:00 sharp; the Monday
orchestra should be ready to rehearse by 7:30.  Note that this is
different from last time.  Plan to arrive a little early so that
we can tune with extra care.  Please keep your music with you when
you're not playing, so that it doesn't get mixed up with the other
orchestra.

<p>We'll open the door to your friends and relatives at 7:55 and begin
the concert at 8 pm.  After the performance we will have refreshments.
The Wednesday orchestra should contribute something simple to drink
for the refreshment table.  The Monday orchestra should bring
something to eat.  Note that this is reversed from last time.

<p>Many little tasks need to be done before and after the rehearsal/concert,
and we would be appreciative if some of you would volunteer 3-5
minutes of your time to help.  The Wednesday players could help by
setting up chairs on the stage, passing out programs or getting
the lighting figured out, The Monday orchestra players could help
by setting up the table for refreshments and and restoring the
stage to its original configuration after the concert.  If everyone
would be responsible for taking home any extra food or drink he or
she brought, the general cleanup will be very simple.  Thanks in
advance for your help.

<p>We will start the spring quarter April 14 for the Monrday orchestra,
and April 16 for the Wednesday orchestra.  If you know you will or
won't be joining us please tell us; it helps with planning music.

<p>
<p>Thanks for your dedication.

<p>Judy and Lorraine
