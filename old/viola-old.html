         <dd>    A violist in an orchestra was crying and screaming at
                 the oboe player sitting directly behind him.
            <br>
            <br>The conductor asked, "What are you so upset about?"
            <br>
	    <br>The violist replied, "The oboist reached over and
	         turned one of the pegs on my viola and now it's all
		 out of tune!"
            <br>
	    <br>The conductor asked, "Don't you think you're overreacting?"
            <br>
            <br>The violist replied "I'm not overreacting! He won't tell
	        me which one!"
