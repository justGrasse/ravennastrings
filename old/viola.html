	    <br> A violist in an orchestra was crying and screaming at
                 the oboe player sitting directly behind him.
            <br>
	    <br> The conductor asked, "What are you so upset about?"
            <br>
            <br> The violist replied, "The oboist reached over and turned
                 one of the pegs on my viola and now it's all out of tune!"
            <br>
	    <br> The conductor asked, "Don't you think you're overreacting?"
            <br>
            <br> The violist replied, "I'm not overreacting! He won't tell me which one!"
